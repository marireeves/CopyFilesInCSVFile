# CopyFilesInCSVFile
This code uses R to take a list of files supplied in a .csv, find them in a folder with many more files, then copy only the ones you want to a new folder. I wrote it to take .csv files from Timelapse (https://github.com/saulgreenberg/Timelapse), but ends up he has already programmed it into this great open source software package for photo review! (https://github.com/saulgreenberg/Timelapse/issues/1). Figured I'd post in case it saved somebody else some time in a different context...
